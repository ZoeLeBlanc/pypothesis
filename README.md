# pypothesis

Python scripts for interacting with the [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) API.

This script (still in progress) calls the hypothes.is API, searches for public annotations from a specific user with a specific hashtag, and writes the results to a markdown file that is Jekyll-friendly.
